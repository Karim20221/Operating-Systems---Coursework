Week 1 - System Planning and Distrubition Selectection

# System Setup
For this part of the coursework, I used two systems including a Linux Server and a Linux Virtual Machine Desktop/Workstation. The server ran without any GUI and is managed entirely via SSH from the workstation.

This setup that I've used mirrors real world server administration and forces the ability to be able to use proper commands rather than relying on GUI to complete tasks.

# Distrubition Choice

Ubuntu server was chosen as it's widely used in the indusitry and it's stable and has some what long term support. Also. it has good documentation allowing it to be easily configured and meaning it will be extremely secure to be able to run commands and use it safely.

# Network Configuration

For this part, a host only network was used on the server to be able to communicate between the workstationa nd the server while remaning isolated, they communicated via a external network to be able to run the commands.

Commands were used such as ip addr to be able to get the IP of both VMs so we could connect them remotely and so they could communicate.

# System Information

System information was collected using standard tools such as free, df and uname and as well ip addr. These commands were used to be able to collect basic system information to be able to complete the tasks.
